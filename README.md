# Simple Flask WebSite on Kubernetes (k8s)

The website in this repo will be automatically deployed with its updates in a Kubernetes Engine hosted on Google Cloud Platform, while the updates are pushed from a local machine.

This repository includes files for building the website and building images in Docker.

The files of auto-deployment on k8s can be viewed in another Github repository (https://github.com/tuyuqi/simple_flask_k8s).
